# Introduction

Thread API is an interface for developing integrations with Thread products. Currently, OpenChair Scheduling is the only product for which there is a publically available API. This API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). 

This document outlines authentication, authorization and resource management for OpenChair bookings within the Thread API. API requests, responses and errors are returned as JSON.

# Authentication

Thread API uses API keys to allow access. This API key must remain a secret. Web clients are prohibited from using this API directly. Thread API expects the API key to be included in all API requests.

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: superlongcharacterstring"
```

> Make sure to replace `superlongcharacterstring` with your API key.

To obtain an API key, reach out to <info@threadcommunication.com>

If you believe your key has been made public or has been compromised, please reach out to <info@threadcommunication.com> immediately and we will generate a new key and invalidate your old key.

# Authorization

Many resources are available without special authorization. Resources marked with a ðŸ”’ require additional authorization. All POST, PUT and DELETE requests require special authorization.

`Authorization: superlongcharacterstring`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>superlongcharacterstring</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# OpenChair Scheduling API
The OpenChair Scheduling API centers around `booking` resources. A booking is an opening for an initial consultation.

There are two main categories of bookings, bookings and range bookings.   

  1. **Booking**: a booking is an opening in the schedule for an initial consultation. When a patient books a booking, they are choosing a real time, e.g. 4:45 PM on Tuesday, and they are expecting an appointment at that exact time. Once a booking is booked, the patient has an appointment.
  2. **Range Booking**: when a patient books a range booking, they are requesting a consultation within a time range (morning, late morning, early afternoon or late afternoon) and they are expecting the office to get back to them with the exact time of their appointment.

A booking can have the following states:   

State | Description
----- | -----------
Open| Booking is available
Pending | Temporarily removes the booking from public view while a patient completes the sign up form
Reserved | Patient has booked but needs an exact time. Only applies to range bookings
Booked | The process is complete and the patient has an appointment

<aside class="notice">
Practices will have <code>bookings</code> or <code>range bookings</code> but not a mix of both.
